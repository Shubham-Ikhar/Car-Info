Ferrari
===========================
history
No history of Ferrari is complete without mentioning that Enzo Ferrari worked for Alfa Romeo from 1920 to 1929 (he wanted to get a job at Fiat after WWI, but restrictions on civilian auto traffic in Italy meant the company wasn't hiring) and that he raced Alfas for another 10 years after that. From the time he was 12, according to "Ferrari: The Man and His Machines", Enzo knew he wanted to be a race driver. At Alfa, he achieved that dream and adopted the cavallino, or prancing horse, the insignia for his Alfa race car. In 1929, he left Alfa to start Scuderia Ferrari in Modena, his privately owned Alfa Romeo racing team.

The 1930s: Scuderia Ferrari
In 1929, Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo's employment to start his own racing stable (scuderia in Italian). Scuderia Ferrari did not race cars with the Ferrari name, though the Alfas they used on the track did sport the prancing horse. Race cars came to the scuderia from Alfa for tuning for almost a decade, and the Ferrari shop in Modena built its first car, the Alfa Romeo 158 Grand Prix racer, in 1937. In 1938, Alfa took its racing program in-house, and Enzo Ferrari went with it. After 10 years on his own, though, working for someone else proved difficult. He left Alfa (or was dismissed) for the last time in 1939.

The 1940s: Ferrari Survives the War
When Enzo Ferrari left Alfa Romeo, he agreed to not use his name in connection with racing for four years. That wasn't so bad; WWII curtailed racing for most of those four years anyway. Ferrari moved from Modena to Maranello during the war, where it remains today. In 1945, Ferrari began work on the 12-cylinder engine the company would be famous for, and in 1947, Enzo Ferrari drove the first 125 S out of the factory gates. Post-war racing was Ferrari's finest hour on the track. Driver Luigi Chinetti was the first to import Ferrari cars to the U.S. in the late 1940s, including the first highway Ferrari, the 166 Inter.

The 1950s: Race- and Road-Ready
During the 1950s, Ferrari had legendary engineers like Lampredi and Jano on the payroll, and bodies designed by the legendary Pinin Farina. Every time a race car was improved, the road car was the beneficiary. In 1951, a Ferrari 375 brought the team its first victory -- over Alfa Romeo, no less. The 357 America hit the market in 1953, as did the first in the long line of 250 GTs. Production of all Ferrari cars grew from 70 or 80 a year in 1950 to more than 300 by 1960. Enzo suffered a personal tragedy in 1956, when his son Dino, who had helped develop Ferrari's V6 engine, died of muscular dystrophy at the age of 24.

The 1960s: Turbulent Times
The '60s started out pretty good for Ferrari: Phil Hill won the Formula 1 championship in 1961 using a 1.5-liter V6 race car nicknamed "Dino." It was the era of the sexy, swooping 250 Testa Rossa. But things got rough for the Prancing Horse, like when Carroll Shelby brought his Cobra to European race tracks. After years of rivalry, the Texan beat the Italian in 1964. Ferrari was having financial troubles as well, but that was nothing new. There were talks with Ford about a buyout, but Enzo Ferrari instead walked out on that deal and sold part of the company to Fiat in 1969.

The 1970s: What Gas Crisis?
The V6 engine made it to a production model in the Dino 246 of the early '70s. In 1972, the company built the Fiorano test circuit next to the factory. Ferrari introduced the Berlinetta Boxer flat-12 engine to the world at the 1971 Turin Motor Show in the 365 GT/4 Berlinetta Boxer, and the car hit showrooms in 1976. The next year, Carozzeria Scaglietti di Modena, Ferrari's design house, was officially incorporated into the company. Cars were churned out, by Ferrari standards, with some models being built in the thousands. But the '70s ended on an odd note with the introduction of the automatic (but still V12) 400i.

The 1980s: Greed Is Good...for Ferrari
Let's skip to 1985 when one of the most iconic of all Ferraris appeared on posters across the world: the Testarossa (note that this time, the model name is one word, not two). The '80s also saw the convertible Mondial and the realization of Enzo Ferrari's dream, the F40. It was built to commemorate the company's 40th anniversary, with a carbon-fiber body, a giant wing, and Kevlar panels. Ferrari's brand recognition was at an all-time high, with a (replica) 1961 250 GT starring in "Ferris Bueller's Day Off". But in 1988, Enzo Ferrari died, at the age of 90. Fiat's share of Ferrari rose to 90%, and son Piero became VP.

The 1990s to Current: A New Era
In 1991, Luca di Montezemolo took the reins of the Prancing Horse. The supercar streak continued with the F50, but the '90s had a wider offering of smaller engines, like the V8 in the F355 series. There were still V12s to be had, of course, like the Testarossa that continued to be built through the mid-90s. In 2003, Enzo Ferrari got his due, with a 230-mph supercar named after the company's founder. On the track, the hot-blooded Ferrari cars met their match in the cool German driving of Michael Schumacher, who raced Ferraris to seven F1 championships between 1994 and 2004.
===========================
F8 Tributo
Ferrari promised to reveal new info about its 488 GTB replacement and here it is. The car’s named the F8 Tributo and it carries on what makes the two-seater Berlinetta so good. The F8 Tributo keeps a V8 engine and some of the sexiest curves we’ve seen in a while.

At first glance, the car’s 3.9-liter twin-turbo V8 engine may not seem all that impressive in the age of hybrid-powered supercars, but then you see the power numbers and smile. The engine produces 710 hp and 568 lb-ft of torque. Also, the peak torque comes earlier in the rev range, letting you more easily access all of that power.

This means the F8 Tributo will shoot from a standstill to 60 mph in as little as 2.9 seconds. It’ll hit 124 mph in just 7.8 seconds and 211 mph flat out. The car features the Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer and Side Slip Angle Control. The vehicle appears to borrow quite a lot of equipment from the 488 Pista, which isn’t a bad thing considering that car’s prowess on a racetrack.

The F8 Tributo has a similar overall shape the car it’s replacing. With that said, it doesn’t look the same. The aero kit, headlights, taillights, and the body look different, but the car utilizes the same platform as the 488 GTB. The completely redesigned interior of the car looks breathtaking, but it, too, is similar to the outgoing car. Nothing is the same, but it has a very similar overall layout with improvements where needed.

The F8 Tributo takes its place in Ferrari’s lineup as the best V8 Berlinetta yet to come from the brand. It’s a notable improvement over the 488 GTB without throwing away everything that car got right. Ferrari will bring the car to the Geneva Motor Show where you can see it in person.
============================================

F8 Spider
The F8 Spider has a two-piece roof that folds away in a mere 14 seconds. This is mid-engine drop-top motoring done right. Where the F8 Tributo’s glass engine cover was, the car gets some flying buttresses. The engine in the F8 Spider is hidden from view, but other than an S duct at the front, the car is pretty much the same as the F8 Tributo. In other words, gorgeous. 

When it comes to the car’s mechanical and technical aspects, there isn’t much different than the F8 Tributo. The F8 Spider gets a 3.9-liter twin-turbo V8 engine. The engine makes 710 hp and 569 lb-ft of torque. The company claims there’s no turbo lag either, meaning you’ll have power on demand without hesitation. 

The car also gets things like Ferrari’s Adaptive Performance Launch and Side Slip Control that are on the F8 Tributo. Now that the F8 Spider is here.
===============================================

The812 GTS

If you’re after a front-engine drop-top Ferrari, then you’ll love the 812 GTS. The car offers a convertible hardtop that retracts out of the way in just 14 seconds. You can fold the thing at speeds up to 28 mph, too. A couple of buttressed tonneau covers. The rear is where most of the styling differences come. The rest of the car is pretty much the same as the coupe. 

Built using the 812 Superfast as the basis for the car, the 812 GTS offers a 6.5-liter V12 naturally aspirated engine that makes 787 hp and 529 lb-ft of torque. The 0-62 mph time for the drop-top 812 is said to be under three seconds. The car will make it to 124 mph in just 8.3 seconds. 

The 812 GTS has been designed from an aerodynamics standpoint to reduce as much unwanted noise as possible. This means you should be able to drive, hear the V12 scream, and smile all day long.
=============================
GTC4Lusso
Ferrari has launched the GTC4Lusso in India at a price of Rs 5.2 crore. The company has also launched the GTC4Lusso T variant at Rs 4.2 crore (both prices ex-showroom India). The GTC4Lusso is is essentially a replacement to the FF. 

It is powered by a 6.3-litre petrol engine pumps out 689PS of power and 697Nm of torque. The power is effectively harnessed by a dual-clutch, 7-speed automatic transmission and is fed to all four wheels. Since those power figures are slightly more than its predecessor, they pay dividend at performance testing. 0-100kmph is dealt in 3.4 seconds and the GTC4Lusso reaches a top-speed of 335kmph. While the former is 0.3 seconds quicker, the latter is exactly the same as that of the FF.

The GTC4Lussco T, on the other hand, gets a 3.9-litre V8 engine that puts ouut 610PS of power and 760Nm of torque. It comes mated to the same 7-speed dual-clutch unit as the GTC4Lusso. The setup is enough for the car to complete the 0-100kmph sprint in a 3.5 seconds and reach a top speed of 320kmph.

Although it is way more expensive and has two doors less, the Ferrari sums up as a rival to the Aston Martin Rapide, Bentley Flying Spur W12 and the Porsche Panamera Turbo.

Portofino
We already know that if you want a faster and more performance oriented Ferrari, you wouldn’t be shopping for a Ferrari Portofino.

However, the Portofino for what it is – is unquestionably a great improvement over its predecessor. Afterall, it has more power and less weight, while being more enjoyable to drive and arguably, better looking than the California T that it is replacing.

Auto journalists such as Car Magazine and Car and Driver note that the Portofino is very engaging to drive spiritedly, sans the desire to go around breaking any lap records. Ultimately, the Ferrari Portofino is the amalgamation of what it was designed to be – a Ferrari which offers a unique blend of daily driving practicality, performance, and luxury.

The Ferrari Portofino will probably strike a chord with those who are cross-shopping in this segment. Interestingly, 70% of buyers of the California T were new customers to the marque. If the Portofino is able to achieve similar success, I would consider that a big win for Ferrari.

Roma
 Ferrari revealed the Roma, an all-new grand touring machine. Now the car company has revealed the details of its new car that harkens back to the GTs of old. The vehicle is a stunning thing to look at, with a minimalist (by today’s standards) grille and a shark-nose front end. It’s long, lean, and so utterly Ferrari that it makes all the right places on a true car enthusiast ache with want.

The specifications and details only exacerbate this. The car gets a turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 engine with new camp profiles and a speed sensor that allows the maximum rpm to rise by 5,000 rpm. In other words, this is an Italian Stallion that can truly sing. The engine has a single-piece exhaust manifold that’s designed to make the most of the engine’s efforts. All told, it makes 612 hp and 560 lb-ft of torque.

The gearbox for the car is an eight-speed dual-clutch unit (alas, no manual). The transmission’s design is derived from the gearbox used in the new SF90 Stradale. The Roma gets longer gear ratios and a reverse gear. The SF90 Stradale uses the electric motor for reverse. 

The vehicle weighs 3,245 pounds. Its turbocharged V8 can shoot the car from 0-62 mph in just 3.4 seconds. Zero to 124 mph happens in a mere 9.3 seconds, and the model has a top speed of 199 mph. The vehicle also gets the latest iteration of SSC. This system works alongside the e-diff, F1-Trac system, SCM-E Frs, and Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer system to make the vehicle truly wonderful to drive. 

Inside, you get what Ferrari calls 2+ seating, meaning the back seats (if you can call them that) are pretty much useful only for some luggage. There’s a new steering wheel with haptic controls, a 16-inch digital instrument cluster, an 8.4-inch infotainment system (it’s optional), and a passenger 8.8-inch widescreen display for settings and navigation. There are also many driver assistance systems, including adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, blind-spot detection, and cross-traffic alert. 

================================
Monza
Of all the cars to debut in the last couple of years, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 are probably the most unforgettable. They harken back to the old school, open-top racecars of old while still leaving room for innovation and utterly astonishing modern design and speed.

As soon as they hit the real world, they became modern collector items. They’re simply stunning machines with no true competitor. They’re the first of what the Prancing Horse dubbed its Icona cars. If Ferrari is able to produce more amazing models like this then we’re all very lucky people to partake in the experience, even if the closest you ever get to these cars is the video above. 

Watch and listen to this beautifully shot short video and imagine what it’s like to whip this car through city streets or around the bend on an Italian country road.

Porsche, Lamborghini, Koenigsegg, McLaren, and Bugatti all do what they do well, but there will only ever be one Ferrari. It’s cars like the Monza SP1 and SP2 and videos like this that make the brand what it is.

For the uninitiated, the Monza SP1 and SP2 are beautiful machines powered by a monster of a V12 engine that makes more than 800 hp can propel these cars from 0-60 mph in under three seconds and 124 mph in just 7.9 seconds. It has a top speed of 186 mph. The cars are aerodynamic and low to the ground, making them the ideal car for the driver looking for a unique open-air experience.

488PistaSpider

Ferrari’s 488 Pista takes the “regular” 488 GTB to the next-level; even more so than what previous special series cars did for their respective standard models. The Pista is the beneficiary of an abundance of dynamics and technologies carried over from competitive racing, most notably in the FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).
Ferrari decided to surprise the world by unveiling the 488 Pista Spider at the Pebble Beach Concours D’elegance event in California later that year in August. The Spider is a convertible version of the 488 Pista coupe, and comes with a removal hardtop; though some would argue it functions more like a targa top vehicle. Ferrari also revealed that the new 488 Pista Spider would become the 50th convertible model in the company’s history.

Performance-wise, the Spider is indistinguishable from the coupe, sharing the same twin-turbocharged 3.9L V8 engine. In spite of its 100kg weight penalty – the result of the electronically-mechanized retractable roof and its components – the Spider still manages identical performance feats as the coupe, with a 0-100 km/h time of 2.85 seconds and a top speed of 340 km/h with the top up.  

Besides the roof,  the Spider visually differentiates itself from the coupe with an array of unique aerodynamic enhancements – all necessary changes to ensure that the Spider remained shoulder-to-shoulder with its fixed-top variant at the racetrack. The Spider is also fitted with its own special livery.

SF90 Stradale

Ferrari’s SF90 Stradale hybrid supercar is a stunning new hybrid supercar that offers 989 hp from a plug-in hybrid powertrain. It features a plug-in hybrid setup that utilizes a turbocharged 3.9-liter V8 paired to three electric motors. 

Two of those electric motors are mounted on the front axle and one is mounted between the engine and the gearbox. This setup with the V8 and electric motors makes the Ferrari good for a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time. The powertrain is the most powerful of any Ferrari and puts the SF90 Stradale atop the Ferrari lineup. 

The car also features an all-new chassis made of carbon fiber and aluminum. The sleek body panels and its aerodynamic shape help the model make a whopping 860 pounds of downforce at speed, and the whole profile of the car is extremely low so it can slash through the air at high speeds. It has a two-piece rear wing that comes from the company’s work in F1 racing.

While the SF90 Stradale features many firsts for the company, it’s not all new ideas. The car looks like a Ferrari and even has a flying buttress and a split glass area at the rear. The rectangular-shaped taillights and the dual exhaust ane absolutely gorgeous. At the front, you have a low nose and some interestingly shaped headlights that are new for the brand. 

Inside the car, there’s a 16-inch fully digital HD screen and a driver’ focused cabin. The leather, Alcantara and other materials look unparalleled, and we actually like the fact that it’s not all carbon fibered out on the inside. It’s an attractive, modern, but simple interior built for the driver, and it’s as good looking as the exterior.
