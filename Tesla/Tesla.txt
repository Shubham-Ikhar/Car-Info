Tesla
===========================
hitory
Tesla was founded in 2003, shortly after GM destroyed the prototypes for its electric vehicle, the EV-1. In 2004, Elon Musk came to the fledgling company and provided much of the initial capital support to run it. It was founded with the idea to create effective electric cars and sell them to the masses. To do so, it created a 3 tiered strategy. The first phase was to release a sports car, which was then the only effective type of electric vehicle in terms of return on investment. It would be followed by a $60,000 sedan, and eventually a $30,000 sedan, sold to the masses.

As often has happened with Elon Musk’s companies, the timeline for these events was a bit off. The first phase, the Tesla Roadster, was released in 2008, and was slightly more expensive than anticipated. It was sold for about 4 years, and has not been manufactured since. The Tesla Roadster that SpaceX sent in to space was purchased by Elon Musk in 2009

Model3
 Tesla to expand operations to India with partial presence by end of 2019, says CEO Elon Musk. The Model 3 is the brand’s entry level four-door electric sedan, with the first production rolling off the line on 7 July 2017, with the official launch on 28 July. Since then, Tesla is working on increasing production capacity for the highly popular electric vehicle and has already delivered more than 84,000 units.

July 04, 2017: Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has announced that the Model 3 has passed all regulatory requirements for production and the serial number 1 sedan will be ready to roll out of the assembly line on July 07, 2017. Tesla also announced that its deliveries will begin from July 28.  

In April 2016, Tesla made world premiere of a near-production prototype of the Model 3. Elon Musk assured during its reveal that the base variant of the Model 3 will start around $35,000 (nearly INR 22 Lakhs). It will also have the Model S/X’s Ludicrous mode and will be equipped with full self-driving hardware. Its final production-spec model, features and specifications will be revealed in coming days. 
======================================
Model S
The Tesla Model S has been the flagship model for the brand and has been helping Tesla beat its competition such as the BMW 7-Series, Audi A8 and Mercedes-Benz S-Class in not only the United States but also in the European markets on several occasions. The electric sedan with the liftback design form is available in a choice of three variants- 75D, 100D and the P100D which is the top of the line. The P100D in its ludicrous mode can do a 100kmph from a standstill in a mere 2.5 seconds.

Us Indians will have to wait a long time to witness these hair raising numbers. At least until there are proper and stable policies and infrastructure in place regarding the EVs. For the time being, you can just check out the first Tesla Model X that landed in India here.
=========================================
Model X
The Tesla Model X is an electric vehicle and one of the fastest SUVs available globally. Offered with an all-wheel drive setup, the Tesla SUV is a seven-seater which can travel 475km in a single charge. The Model X is quick too and accelerates from 0 to 97kmph in just 2.9seconds. The last two rows of the vehicle can be folded flat to liberate more cargo space. In the US market, it is available as a five-seater, six-seater and seven-seater options. 

It gets features like maps and navigation with real time traffic information, active safety technologies, including collision avoidance and automatic emergency braking, LED fog lights, three-position dynamic LED turning lights, largest glass panoramic windshield in production, automatic keyless entry, etc. 

The Tesla Model X drives its power from 75 kWh or 100 kWh lithium-ion battery. To tackle the Model X challenge, China’s electric start-up Nio has launched its first vehicle that promises to have all the traits of the Tesla vehicle at half its price. The Tesla Model X price starts at $79,500 (approximately Rs 52 lakh).
