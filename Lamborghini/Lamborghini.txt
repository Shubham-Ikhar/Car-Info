history
On April 28, 1916, Ferruccio Lamborghini, the founder of the company that bears his name and is known for stylish, high-performance cars, is born in Italy.

After World War II, Lamborghini founded a business making tractors from reconfigured surplus military machines, near Bologna, Italy. He later expanded into other ventures, including manufacturing air-conditioning and heating systems, and grew rich. Lamborghini’s success enabled him to purchase a variety of luxury sports cars, including a Ferrari, considered one of the top cars of the time. After experiencing mechanical difficulties with his Ferrari, Lamborghini decided to start his own rival sports car company, even hiring a former top Ferrari engineer. Automobili Lamborghini was officially established in 1963 in Sant’Agata Bolognese, Italy, and the same year debuted its first car, the Lamborghini 350 GTV, a two-seater coupe with a V12 engine.

The company’s logo featured a bull, a reference to Ferruccio Lamborghini’s zodiac sign, Taurus the bull. Various Lamborghini models had names related to bulls or bullfighting, including the Miura (named for Don Eduardo Miura, a breeder of fighting bulls), a mid-engine sports car that was released in mid-1960s and gained Lamborghini an international following among car enthusiasts and a reputation for prestige and cutting-edge design.

In the early 1970s, Lamborghini’s tractor business experienced problems and he eventually sold his interest in his sports car business and retired to his vineyard. Automobili Lamborghini changed hands several times and in the late 1990s was purchased by German automaker Volkswagen. The company continued to build high-performance cars, including the Murcielago (capable of going over 200 mph) and the Gallardo. Ferruccio Lamborghini died on February 20, 1993, at the age of 76.

 Aventador
The super car from Lamborghini-Aventador is about to receive a mid-life facelift. To be named Lamborghini Aventador S, the facelift version will first be launched in European markets followed by launch in India sometime next year. Delving into the changes the supercar will receive, subtle updates will be made to the exterior with face getting a sportier treatment and additional styling updates made to the rear. In addition to aforementioned changes, the supercar will get a bump in power, making 40hp more power than the preceding model. 

Coming to the engine on the 2017 Lamborghini Aventador S, the supercar uses the LP 740-4 petrol engine with 6.5 litre capacity. As mentioned above, the V12 unit will not be tuned to deliver 40hp more power at 730bhp, however the torque remains unchanged at 690Nm. For transmitting power, it will use the 7-speed ISR gearbox directing power to rear wheels. With the power bumped up by 40hp, the sports car will effortlessly sprint to 100km/h from rest within 2.9 seconds while attaining a top speed of 350km/h.

Huracan
The Lamborghini Huracan Performante was first unveiled at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show and now within a couple of months the supercar has been launched in India. Huracan Performante is inspired by the Huracan Super Trofeo race car and thus gets the sporty cosmetic enhancements and several race spec features that make it the brand's most powerful V10 till date. The new Lamborghini Huracan Performante is 40 kg lighter than the regular Huracan. And that was possible because of Lamborghini’s proprietary forged composite carbon fibre. The car’s front bumper, rear spoiler, engine cover, rear bumper, and diffuser are made up of this material.

The car is powered by the same 5.2 litre V10 from the regular Huracan but for the Huracan Performante, Lamborghini has made few upgrades like titanium valves, revised intake and lighter exhaust. This enables the car to churns out a massive 630 bhp and develops 600 Nm of peak torque. The engine comes mated to a 7-speed dual clutch transmission the sends power from 0-100 kmph in just 2.9 seconds, thanks to the reduced weight.

The Huracan Performante also gets Lamborghini's Aerodinamica Lamborghini Attiva, a new active aerodynamic tech allowing the car to switch between maximum downforce and low drag setups by adjusting flaps at the front and rear. This helps the car to create maximum vertical downforce, which is 750 per cent more than a Huracan coupe.
